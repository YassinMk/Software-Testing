# 🧪Software Testing

# What is software testing?

Software Testing is the practice of integrating quality checks throughout the software development cycle. The purpose of testing is to check whether the software matches expected requirements and ensure error-free software.

## Test cases:

Test cases can be written in different stages of the SDLC and may vary depending on the type of test or the method used to develop the software, such as Agile or waterfall. A test case contains steps, inputs, data, and the expected corresponding outputs. Regardless of the test type or development method, test cases should always be written after requirements are finalized.

## Type of Testing :

Software testing helps evaluate the software to identify whether or not the software product meets requirements and is error-free. Types of testing can be broadly classified into three categories: **Functional testing, Non-Functional testing, Regression testing**

### 👉 **Functional Testing :**

Functional testing usually involves black box testing which is a method of testing without looking at source code or internal structure. Functional testing is only concerned with inputs and corresponding outputs of the system under test, also called the SUT. It is entirely based on testing functional requirements. Functional testing can be carried out manually or using automated tools.

### 👉 Purpose of functional testing :

The goal is to test the functionality of the application making sure the application is usable and accessible. Functional testing tests the SUT, to make sure it meets functional requirements. Functional testing makes certain that when user errors or input edge cases do occur, the software handles those exceptions seamlessly by displaying appropriate error messages.

### 👉 Non-functional testing attributes :

Non-functional testing includes testing the application for attributes like performance, security, scalability, and availability. Non-functional testing checks to see if the SUT's non-functional behavior is performing properly.

### 👉 Non-functional testing question :

Non-functional testing should answer questions like the following: How does the application behave under stress? What happens when many users log in at the same time? Are the instructions in documents and user manuals consistent with the application’s behavior? Does the application behave similarly under different operating systems? How does the application handle disaster recovery? How secure is the application?

## 📝Testing levels :

Now that we have discussed different types of testing, let’s discuss testing levels. There are four testing levels: unit, integration, system, and acceptance. Each level occurs at a different time in the SDLC. There are 4 different levels to reduce the amount of time spent on testing by preventing overlap.

- There are three categories of testing: functional, non-functional, and regression.
- Integration testing looks for errors when two or more small chunks of code are combined.
- System testing validates the system as a fully completed product.
- Acceptance testing verifies the implementation of user requirements and business processes.
